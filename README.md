> [!NOTE]
> The maintenance of this package is currently limited to keeping it working with new versions of Julia and GR as it is. No new features or improvements are meant to be added, and "difficult" bugs may take time to be addressed (if ever), unless other developers feel motivated to take over it.

This package is an experimental refactoring of the module `jlgr` from [GR.jl](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl), intended to provide the main utilities of `jlgr` in a more "Julian" and modular style, easy to read, and facilitate code contributions by others.

Find all the information about how GRUtils works its [documentation pages](https://heliosdrm.github.io/GRUtils.jl/), and feel free to submit your [issues](https://github.com/heliosdrm/GRUtils.jl/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/heliosdrm/GRUtils.jl/pulls)!
