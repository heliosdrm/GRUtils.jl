# Introduction to GRUtils

GRUtils This package is a refactoring of the module `jlgr` from [GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl). The purpose of GRUtils is to provide the main utilities of `jlgr` in a more "Julian" and modular style, easier to read, and facilitate code contributions by others.

GRUtils is being maintained in a package apart from GR, in order to make its development faster, but if some day it reaches sufficient quality to be considered a valuable contribution to GR, its author will be happy to give away its code so that it can be integrated in the excellent package created by [Joseph Heinen](https://github.com/jheinen/).
